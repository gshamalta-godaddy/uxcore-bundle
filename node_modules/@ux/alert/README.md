### Breaking changes for 2200
- Component is now functional and inherits all props from `@ux/dialog`, defaulting to use `as='alert'`.
- Related to previous point, the `title` and `id` props are now required for accessibility.
- The `title` prop expects a `@ux/text` component.
- The `button` prop has been removed, use `actions` instead with the same value, allowing for multiple `@ux/button` components.
- Showing / hiding this component is done through conditional rendering. `dismissable` has been deprecated.

### Migration to v2002

- The `type` prop has been replaced by `emphasis` with the following name changes. All other types are otherwise still as previously provided.
 - `danger` -> `critical`
 - `offer` -> `highlight`
 - `note` -> `neutral`
 - `c3` -> `internal`
- The `header` and `message` props have been removed, see next bullet and examples for new composition.
- The alert no longer allows for hidden messaging within a collapsible control, all messaging should be available on render.
- The use of `children` is for providing the message with optional formatting. For adding buttons, see next point.
- If you'd like to include a CTA, use the `button` prop with a `@ux/button`. It will be displayed as per Design Foundation guidelines.
- The `.alert` class has been deprecated and replaced with `.ux-alert`, managed by this package.
- The alert does not include margin on it by default.
- Add a class to the alert to add additional layout styles (ie. position).
- The ability to add a custom icon has been removed.

### Props

Props are inherited from `@ux/dialog`

 Prop | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| `actions` | `Elements` | The actions that a user can take after reading the contents of the notification. These are expected to be `@ux/button` components. |
| `ariaLabels` | `Object` | A configuration object of aria-labels to be added within the component. The `close` value is added to the close button when provided. |
| `children` | `Node` | Adds children to the content container. |
| `emphasis` | `String` | Determines the status of the component. |
| `id` | `String` | Provides an accessibility relationship between the `title` and the component. |
| `onClose` | `Function` | The callback that fires once the user attempts to dismiss the notification. |
| `title` | `String` | The title for the notification. This is expected to be a `@ux/text` component. |

#### `emphasis` options

Any feedback modifier from `@ux/intents` can be used as a value for `emphasis`. Here are some examples:

- critical
- success
- warning
- info
- highlight
- neutral
- internal
