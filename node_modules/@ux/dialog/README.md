```

## Usage

```js
import Dialog from '@ux/dialog';
import text from '@ux/text';
export default function (props) {
  const [show, setShow] = React.useState(true);
  return <section>
    { show && <Dialog role='alert' title={ <h2.text text='Wait!' /> } id='example-alert'>
      Here is a very important message
    </Dialog> }
  </section>
}
```

If you are looking for more styled components, please refer to `@ux/alert`, `@ux/growl`, `@ux/modal` etc.

## Props
