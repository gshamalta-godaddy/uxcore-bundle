# Fieldset

The `fieldset` component assists in displaying children input state. 

## Installation

The module is released in our private npm registry under the `@ux` scope and can
be installed by running:

```
npm install @ux/fieldset
```

## Usage

Fieldset is what wraps input and is consumed by the `@ux/form-element` component. 
The fieldset component can be imported using:

```js
import Fieldset from '@ux/fieldset'
```

### Properties

The component can be manipulated using the following properties:

- `proxy` Do not render the element in a fieldset but render the children instead.
- `inline` Render children inline on the same row. This also adds `margin-right` to all children but the last.
