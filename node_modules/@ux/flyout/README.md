# @ux/flyout

This component is the base level of all items that are visually anchored to another element, expected to appear on top of the UI. Examples will include dropdowns and tooltips.

## Installation

```sh
npm i @ux/flyout
```

## Usage

```js
import Flyout from '@ux/flyout';

export default function (props) {
  const [show, setShow] = React.useState(false);
  const anchorRef = React.useRef(null);

  const flyoutTrigger = (
    <button
      aria-labelledby='my-flyout'
      ref={ anchorRef }
      onClick={ () => setShow(!show) }>
      Click to toggle flyout
    </button>
  );

  const flyoutContent = (
    <p>Here is some flyout content</p>
  );

  return (
    <>
      { flyoutTrigger }
      { show && <Flyout anchorRef={ anchorRef } id='my-flyout'>
        { flyoutContent }
      </Flyout> }
    </>
  );
}
```

## Props
| Prop | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| `anchorRef` | `React ref` | Reference to the DOM node to attach the flyout visually, this should be a `ref`. |
| `arrow` | `Boolean` | Display an arrow which connects to the anchor. |
| `placement` | `String` | Determines the placement of the flyout, possible options are below. |
| `portalElem` | `Element` | An element to attach the flyout to, helpful for preventing overflow clipping |
| `strategy` | `String` | The positioning strategy of either `absolute` or `fixed` |
| `role` | `String` | The role to be applied to the flyout |
| `onClose` | `Function` | A callback fired when an event occurs outside the context of the flyout or anchor |
| `onPlacement` | `Function` | A callback fired when the flyout needs to change placement, argument is the new placement |
| `stretch` | `Boolean` | Stretches the flyout to the nearest relative ancestor |


### `placement`
List of accepted placements to use as values of the placement option.
Valid placements are:

- `auto`
- `top`
- `right`
- `bottom`
- `left`

Each placement can have a variation from this list:

- `-start`
- `-end`

Variations are interpreted easily if you think of them as the left to right written languages. Horizontally (top and bottom), start is left and end is right.
Vertically (left and right), start is top and end is bottom.

Some valid examples are:

- `top-end` (on top of reference, right aligned)
- `right-start` (on right of reference, top aligned)
- `bottom` (on bottom, centered)
- `auto-end` (on the side with more space available, alignment depends by placement)

When using as a tooltip, we suggest changing the placement to `top` (default for component is `bottom-start`).
