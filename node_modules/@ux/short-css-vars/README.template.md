# @ux/short-css-vars

Utility to shorten the names of CSS variables in stylesheets.

## Overview

CSS variables are renamed with a unique hash that is consistent across processed
files. This allows you to have common style files that reference variables with
varying values defined in theme files.

## Formatting

The default formatter uses the popular [string-hash] with a djb2-like algorithm,
then [base-36] encodes the result. In the rare chance of collisions, an error
will be thrown with the colliding names. A custom formatter can provided via
the [options](#new-shortcssvarsoptions)

## Installation

```
$ npm install @ux/short-css-vars
```
