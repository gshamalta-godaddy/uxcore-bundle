# @ux/style-common

An internal css-in-js library for UXCore2

## Installation

In order to install this package run:

```bash
npm i @ux/style-common
```

## Usage

The `@ux/style-common` library contains the css-in-js/linaria equivalent to `@ux/scss-common`. An example usage of this looks like:

```jsx harmony
import '@ux/style-common';
```

This would be included in the root of your appliction/bundle as it will be run through babel/linaria to compile css and inject it into the global space
