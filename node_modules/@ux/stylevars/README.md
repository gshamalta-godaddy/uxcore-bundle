# @ux/stylevars

An internal library for converting components into using linaria

## Installation

In order to install this package run:

```bash
npm i @ux/stylevars
```

## Usage

The `@ux/stylevars` library contains the css-in-js equivalent to `@ux/scss-definitions`. An example usage of this looks like:

```jsx harmony
import { functions, variables, mixins } from '@ux/stylevars';
```

Each of the top level imports are objects which contain the converted variables, functions, mixins, etc. from scss-commons (note: there are some that were not converted as it was legacy code)

## Test

To run tests for this library:

```bash
npm test
```
