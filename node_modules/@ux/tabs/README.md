# Tabs

React tabs Component that can be used standalone or with content.

## Installation

The module is released to our private npm registry and can be installed by
running:

```bash
npm install --save @ux/tabs
```

> To develop locally for this module use `@storybook/react` and `@exemplar/storybook-react`:
> ```
> npm run storybook
> ```

## Usage

```js
import Tabs, { TabIndex, Tab, TabContent } from '@ux/tabs';
import React, { Component } from 'react';

export default class Example extends Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <Tabs>
        <TabIndex>
          <Tab>My first tab</Tab>
          <Tab>Second</Tab>
        </TabIndex>

        <TabContent>Content belonging to tab one</TabContent>
        <TabContent>Second content</TabContent>
      </Tabs>
    );
  }
}
```

Child components will be validated through `propTypes`. Plain HTML or other
components can only be supplied to `Tab` or `TabContent`. The following components
can only have children of type:

- Tabs: TabIndex or TabContent
- TabIndex: Tab

This ensures HTML structure is correct and that a working Tabs component is
rendered.

### Tabs with content

`Tabs` can have `TabContent` children. The order of the tabs will
correspond with the order of `TabContent`.

### Standalone tabs

Tabs can be used standalone where a wrapping component will pass the `change` handler
and `selected` property as properties to `Tabs`.

```js
<Tabs change={/* function */} selected={/* index of selected tab */} />
```

Alternatively the onChange handler can be overridden by extending the default `Tabs` implementation.

```js
import { Tabs } from '@ux/tabs';

class MyTabs extends Tabs {
  // Override default change handler
  change() {}
}
```

### Changing animation steps

The amount that the conveyor moves when clicking previous and/or next controls is
configurable through `TabIndex`. Provide a number to the `stepSize` property.
By default the stepsize is `200`.

```js
<TabIndex stepSize=100>
```

Note: on mobile no controls are available. Conveyor movement is done through
left and right dragging.

## Test

Make sure dependencies are installed and that you're running on node@4.2 or above.

```bash
npm test
```

To run UI integration tests through webdriver.io make sure `preview` is running in a separate terminal and
execute:

```bash
npm run test:ui
```
