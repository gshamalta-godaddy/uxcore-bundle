# @ux/text-entry

The component is often meant to be used in conjunction with `<FieldFrame/>` (`@ux/field-frame` coming soon) as a replacement for a native HTML `<input/>` when building custom form controls.

## Installation

```sh
npm i @ux/text-entry
```

## Usage

```js
import FieldFrame from '@ux/field-frame';
import TextEntry from '@ux/text-entry';

export default function (props) {
  return <>
    <label htmlFor='my-input'>Username</label>
    <FieldFrame>
      <TextEntry id='my-input'/>
    </FieldFrame>
  </>
}
```

The `<TextEntry/>` component is designed to be _visually invisible_ without the `<FieldFrame/>` component; which provides a border (or other affordance) to signify a field for text input. The purpose of separation for these parts is to allow for other components (eg. `<Button/>`) to appear within the frame.

## Props
| Prop | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| `className` | `String` | Sets a classname on the root component for use in layout placement. |
| `disabled` | `Boolean` | Sets `disabled` on the `<input/>`. |
| `id` | `String` | **This is required** Sets an `id` attribute on the `<input/>`, will also set on `for` attribute on label if provided. |
| `invalid` | `Boolean` | Set style and properties to reflect invalid state. |
| `label` | `String` `React.Component` | Creates a floating label over the input. When a component is given, it is cloned with additional classnames. | 
| `multiline` | `Boolean` | Replaces `<input>` with `<textarea>`. |
| `placeholder` | `String` | Placeholder text for the `<input/>`, if this and `label` are both provided, the `label` will not be shown. |
| `readOnly` | `Boolean` | Sets `readonly` on the `<input/>`. |
| `resize` | `String|Boolean` | For `multiline` use, allows the box to be resized. Allows for any CSS `resize` prop or `Boolean`. `true = 'both'` `false = 'none'` |
| `required` | `String` | Changes the style of the input to reflect a required state. This does _not_ set the `required` property on the `<input/>` but `aria-required` instead. |
| `size`| `Number` | Sizes the input. When using `multiline` this affects the vertical size. However, this will not work with floating labels; the label will determine the size. |
| `suggestion` | `String` | This is text that can allow for a tab to autocomplete functionality to be created. An example in provided in the `/examples` directory. The text here should start with the text currently in the `<input/>` value.
| `type` | `String` | The type of `<input/>`, this only allows for text types (`email`, `url`, etc) |
| `value` | `String` | The value of the `<input/>`.

## `onChange`

The `onChange` signature for this component is provided as the following:

```js
onChange(theUpdatedValueExpected, { event: theOriginalEventFired });
```
