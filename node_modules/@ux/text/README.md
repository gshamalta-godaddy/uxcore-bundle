# @ux/text

The primary purpose of this component package is to be a organizational container to hold the CSS for various styles of text.

## Usage

`@ux/text` CSS is bundled within `@ux/uxcore2`, so the following classes can be added to existing markup to provide consistent text styles. The styles are opt-in by including the `.ux-text` class along with an additional display and/or size class.

Add one of the following modifiers to change the base font size and line height in relation to the type of content:
- `.ux-text-title` - Title text, expect this for lower `<h#>` elements.
- `.ux-text-heading` - Heading text, expect this for higher `<h#>` elements.
- `.ux-text-paragraph` - Paragraph text, expect this for `<p>` elements.
- `.ux-text-label` - Label text, expect this for `<label>` elements.
- `.ux-text-action` - Action text, expect this for `<button>` elements.
- `.ux-text-input` - Input text, expect this for `<input>` or `<textarea>` elements.
- `.ux-text-caption` - Caption text, expect this for help or error text.

To increase the size of the text, use an additional modifier class in the following construction: `.ux-text-size[NUMBER]` where `[NUMBER]` represents a number between `0` and `5`. Example: `.ux-text-size2`. This will increase the size of the text by a factor of `2` from the base of that text. The factor is set by the theme.

Using these modifiers in combination create different styles of text.

```html
<h1 class="ux-text ux-text-heading ux-text-size1">
  This will use the next highest size from the base for
  headings provided by the theme css  
<h1>
<h2 class="ux-text ux-text-title">
  This will use the base size for
  titles provided by the theme css
<h2>
<p class="ux-text ux-text-paragraph">
  This will use the base size for
  paragraphs provided by the theme css
</p>
<span class="ux-text">
  This will use the base size for
  text provided by the theme css.
</span>
```

## Component Usage

This package also exports a `<text.tagName/>` component that can be used in a React codebase.

```jsx
import text from `@ux/text`;

  <text.h2
    as='heading'
    size=1
    text='Hello World'/>
```

### `as`
Modifies the base font size and line height by expecting one of the following values: `title` `heading` `paragraph` `label` `action` `input` `caption`. Default is `null`.

### `emphasis`
Adds a feedback color to the text, these relate to the feedback category of intents. Example `critical`. Default is `null`.

### `size`
A number between 0 and 5 (inclusive) that determines the size of the text based on the scale provided by the theme. Default is `null` and will display the `0` size.

### `text`
The text to display within the tags, you may also provide children but this will warn to use the `text` prop instead as this is expecting to only hold plain text in most cases.

```jsx
<text.p>Hello World</text.p> // Warning: Consider using text prop on @ux/text
```

## `textClasses()`

The package also exports a function that can compose the classes based on the prop. This is helpful for adding `@ux/text` classes to your own components.

```jsx
import textClasses from '@ux/text/classes';

export default function MyComponent() {
  return <h1 className={ textClasses({ as: 'heading', size: 5, className='my-component' }) }>Something extra</h1>
}
```

## Calculations
There are two kinds of variables set at the theme level that determine how the variations between text occur.

### `scaleFactor`
This is the factor used to increase the base using a scale.

Examples: `1.125` `1.414`

### `scaleOperator`
This is the mathematical operator used the increase the scale. 

Examples: `*` `+`

Together along with the provided font size, the additional font sizes can be calculated on a scale. The variable values are expected to be modified at the theme level through the intent system. The current defaults are listed below:
```js
intents.uxText.fontSize = '1rem';
intents.uxText.scaleFactor.fontSize = 1.125;
intents.uxText.scaleOperator.fontSize = '*';

intents.uxText.lineHeight = 1.5;
intents.uxText.scaleFactor.lineHeight = 1;
intents.uxText.scaleOperator.lineHeight = '*';
```
